		<h1>Welcome to Field Day 2024 with the KTQA Irregulars!</h1>

		<p>
			<em>Field Day</em> is an Amateur Radio event about emergency
			preparedness, a game about talking to as many people as 
			possible on the radio, and consuming beverages with your pals.  
			The <em>KTQA Irregular Radio Club</em> is an unofficial name for
			unofficial folks who are working Field Day under the auspices
			of the low power community radio station KTQA-LP.
		</p>

			If you are seeing this page, that means you are participating.
			Awesome!  If you want to participate <i>more</i>, here are some

		<h1>QSO &mdash; How to Do Field Day with a Microphone</h1>

		<p>
			The game part of Field Day is to contact as many stations as possible.
			In order to score points when contacting a station, an <i>exchange</i> must be 
			communicated.
			During Field Day, the exchange is how many transmitters, the <i>class</i> of the
			station being operated, and their location based on certain region codes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additionally, all contacts must be logged.  Our logging is done via
			<a href="/logger">a web site</a>, which will already be on a computer
			near the radio or be done for you by an assistant.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're nervous, know that one of the purposes of Field Day is to
			get new people involved.  Relax!  Most of the operators on the air will
			be courteous and understanding.   The other ones we can just ignore!
			Feel free to listen in on how other people working stations to get
			a feel for how it works.
		</p>

		<p>
			This part of Field Day is a game.   Have fun!

		<h2>Other Things That May Happen</h2>

		<p>
			While it's pretty formal, it's still two people talking.
			There might be a lot of chatter on frequency, the room they're in might be 
			noisy, or they may have forgotten your callsign while sipping their morning
			coffee.   Be prepared to repeat any part of the message.  Here are some other
			hints:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>If you didn't hear the full callsign:</b>  If you heard a station 
				that started with "Kilo 4", you could ask: "Kilo 4 station, again please?"
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>If you don't hear their class or location:</b> W1AW, repeat your
				class/location please.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>If they don’t hear your report, clarify:</b> W1AW, my report
				is Two Alpha Western Washington, QSL?
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>If the frequency is busy, you might have to say their callsign 
				so they know you're talking to them:</b> Whiskey One Alpha Whiskey, this is
				November Nine Michael India India.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<div id="rst">
		<h1>RST Signal Reports</h1>
		<p>
			While not strictly required for Field Day, hams often like to talk about how well&mdash;
			or how poorly&mdash; they can recieve a signal. <em>RST</em> reports are the main method
			used to discuss it.  This will help you understand what you're being told, and to tell
			someone how you're hearing them in return!
		</p>
		<p>
			RST stands for Readability, Strength, and Tone.  Tone is only used for CW 
			(Continuous Wave, i.e. Morse Code), so for phone contacts you will only report 
			readability on a 1-5 scale, followed by strength on a 1-9 scale. For example, "5-9" 
			means that your caller is perfectly readable (understandable) and has a strong signal, 
			whereas "5-3" means that your caller is still perfectly readable even though they 
			have a weak signal.   
		</p>

		<div class="rst">
			<div>
				<h3>Readability</h3>
				<p>This one is based on how well you can hear.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span>1</span> unreadable</li>
					<li><span>2</span> barely readable</li>
					<li><span>3</span> somewhat readable</li>
					<li><span>4</span> readable with little difficulty</li>
					<li><span>5</span> perfectly readable</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Strength</h3>
				<p>This one is based on the "S-meter" on your radio.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span>1</span> faint, barely perceptible signal</li>
					<li><span>2</span> very weak signal</li>
					<li><span>3</span> weak signal</li>
					<li><span>4</span> fair signal</li>
					<li><span>5</span> moderately good signal</li>
					<li><span>6</span> good signal</li>
					<li><span>7</span> moderately strong signal</li>
					<li><span>8</span> strong signal</li>
					<li><span>9</span> extremely strong signal</li>

		<h1>More Information on Field Day 2023</h1>

		<p>
			Field Day, which is kind of like high holidays for ham radio, is put on by the American
			Radio Relay League&mdash; aka the ARRL&mdash; which is kind of like a national knitting
			club for radio folks.
		</p>

		<p>
			Their page about Field Day is at &lt;<a href="https://www.arrl.org/field-day">https://www.arrl.org/field-day</a>&gt;, where
			people who are better at explaining things say:

			<blockquote>
				Field Day is ham radio's open house. Every June, more than 40,000 hams throughout
				North America set up temporary transmitting stations in public places to
				demonstrate ham radio's science, skill and service to our communities and our
				nation. It combines public service, emergency preparedness, community outreach,
				and technical skills all in a single event. Field Day has been an annual event
				since 1933, and remains the most popular event in ham radio.

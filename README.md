# Field Day 2022 Site for the KTQA Irregulars

This is some information that anyone with a smartphone can read about Field Day, which some folks from [KTQA-LP](https://ktqa.org) is doing near Mt. Rainier.

There is an explanatory index page, and then a simple exchange calculator for use with [Cloudlog](https://www.magicbug.co.uk/cloudlog/)'s contest logging feature.

# Field Day 2024 for the KTQA Irregulars

This is attempting to manage the data capture for [Field Day 2023](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) for the *KTQA Irregualr Radio Club*, the unofficial radio club for the nearly-unofficial radio station [KTQA-LP](https://ktqa.org).

As many people who are participating with us this year are not hams, this includes some basic information about what ham radio is and how FD works.  As of 2023, we began work on a functional FD logger.

In 2020 and 2022, we used [CloudLog](https://www.magicbug.co.uk/cloudlog/) to capture our data.   While that eventually worked, it required a lot of SQL finagling to get the data into Cabrillo file format that the ARRL site understood.  Most other field day loggers we could find seemed hard to work with and incomplete, or written for Windows users.  As we are strictly a unix shop, that wouldn't do.

## The logger ain't here no more.

That logger is now it's own project, I'm calling it the "N9MII Logger" for lack of any creativity on my part.   It is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/refutationalist/fdlogger/).

## License

To the extent that this basic website has a licence, it's AGPL3.   That's because the logger is AGPL3 and I guess this got included.   Hooray!

The font I'm using is [RedHat Mono](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont), which is distributed via the OFL.

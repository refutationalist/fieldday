# Camp Quest NorthWest Radio Club Field Day 2025 Notes

Hey everyone!

As you probably know by now, the first day of camp (6/28, before campers arrive) coincides with Field Day 2025, the largest non-contest event of the ham radio calendar.  As you may not know, Camp Quest Northwest now has an ARRL affiliated radio club, and Field Day 2025 will be our inaugural event!

All volunteers (whether they are working the July session or not) are welcome to participate.  If you are expected at training that day, that takes priority though there will still be time during the afternoon and evening to learn about Field Day and operate the radios.  Working Field Day is fun, simple, and great way to get an idea of what ham radio is about.  Don’t be shy!  Written documentation as well as several people will be available to explain how Field Day works.

Becky and I will be arriving at Camp Waskowitz at 9:00 AM to prepare for operations.  The more folks we have the faster we can get it done, so any help will be welcome.   This goes double if you’re a member of the Funk Committee or have familiarity with the radio tent.    Once our radio system is set up the event will begin at 11:00 AM sharp and will last for 24 consecutive hours.  While I’d like us to be able to operate the full time, those of us who are a part of the July session are strongly (and I mean strongly) encouraged to get adequate sleep for the task ahead.

While Field Day proper ends at 11:00 AM, we would like the tent to be up and operational during parent check in from 1:00 to 3:00 PM.   During that time we will be reconfiguring the tent from Field Day to Camp operations.   Once the check-in process is complete, all radio club members (that’s all of you) who are not scheduled for the July session need to head out.

We will hopefully have several antennas and radios for the Field Day event, but much of that equipment will subsequently be taken down for camp, leaving the usual camp radio tent equipment in place.   We hope to see you there!

And now for some technical crap, feel free to skip: 

## That’s nice, but first: Can I bring my own radio?

I expect to operate 2A.   Two transmitters, emergency power.   I’d like a higher number but 2A is what I have infrastructure for.  You are more than welcome to bring your own transmitter, but to operate 3A or 4A you may need to provide your own power and antenna.  I’ll have a logging computer, but you can even log via your phone in a pinch.  Details below.

## Radios:

I plan on having two radios there: one of my FT-991s, and the club’s new FT-710 AESS.  Did you know that AESS stands for “Acoustic Enhanced Speaker System”?   It’s just a ‘710 with a big honking speaker on it.   I dare you to find a less efficient way to say “has speaker.”   We should also have autotuners for both radios.

## Antennas, Feedline, Etc:

Our antenna situation is pretty bleak at the moment— I have three verticals under construction, and I will have the makings for a sizable inverted V with me.   Hopefully, one or more of them will work.   I’ll probably know for sure what worked and what didn’t the night before we head down.   We should have adequate feedline, and the Radio Club of Tacoma has graciously lent us a series of band-pass filters for the event so we don’t need to worry too much about radio separation.

## Electrical Power:

I have 2 100AH LFP batteries: one on the battery box, one not.   Based on past experiences, this is enough power to keep two radios and accoutrements running for the whole 24 hours.   We also have the 100W solar system to feed into the batteries, and sun exposure is much better at Waskowitz than at our usual location, so it’s probably more than enough.

## Space and Enclosure:

We can set up antennas anywhere in the field for Field Day.   All but two (one for HF, one for VHF) will be taken down for the rest of camp.   As far as tents go, we have the new tent provided for us by the ARRL grant as well as our old radio tent for more space as well as tables and chairs for both.    The old tent will either be taken down at the end of FD or reappropriated for other camp uses.

## Logging:

We’ll be using a computerized logger I wrote for Field Day.   I will provide computers.  Some of you may have used it before, it’s really quite simple to use.   I will have spare computers available if you bring your own radio.

## Food, Beverage, and Self Care:

In short form: ever notice how hot it gets during the day at Wasko?   Prepare for that.

Please bring your own food and snacks for Field Day.   There will be some water and such, but you should also bring some refreshments.  Dress for the weather, which very likely includes sunblock.  While we have seating for the tents, we have no real idea how many people are going to want to participate so bringing a good folding chair of your own won’t hurt.

If you decide to work overnight and need a nap, cots are available but keep in mind both the 3PM exit time and that camp is starting up around us.  And once again:  If you are a part of July session, please get enough rest to meet your camp responsibilities.

Also since some of you have done Field Day with me in the past, this bears mentioning:  This year Field Day is an official CQNW event during a camp session and is therefore dry.   No intoxicants, please.


That should cover it!   Hope to see you there!
